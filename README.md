# Preview of the starter-kit

You will find an index file with a '/style' folder were you can run SASS linked to the CSS file by running : <br>
`$ cd data/style` and `$ node scss:css`

If you havent already install NPM and Node.js, install it by clicking on this link https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm and go back here

There is also specific folder mainly used by Web Developer like '/fonts', '/libs' or even '/images'. As well as a JavaScript file linked to the index.

# How to load it ?

You can use the SSH key : `git@github.com:neomiannay/starter.git` <br>
<br>
by running `$ git clone git@github.com:neomiannay/starter.git` <br>
<br>
This will clone the actual starter in the directory you were in <br>
<br>
### Tips :
To know in wich directory you actually are, run `$ pwd` <br>
<br>
To change your directory run `$ cd <path of targeted directory>` for exemple : `$ cd Documents/github/` <br>
<br>
If you're lost, you can alway run `$ cd` to go back on the main directory of your terminal (usualy `/user/<your name>`)

# What about Back-End Developement ?
I will creater a new starter-kit in the furure made for Back-End Developer with PHP files and basic code to run.
